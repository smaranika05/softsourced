        of people who adapt their web using behaviour towards the concept of
        ‘Voice first.’. The voice search revolution is led by the big tech
        companies Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Samsung, Alibaba.

      <b>Voice search devices</b>
      <p>
        On any device featuring voice search automatic speech recognition is
        done through an Artificial Intelligence (AI) that processes oral
        queries. This intelligence is brought to you in the form of voice
        assistants, that, once activated on your device, can process search
        queries through search engines

        After the surge in voice searches on smartphones, the hype has led to
        the development of so called smart speakers that are powered by an
        engine of their respective producer. These engines work with the goal to
        make your and my life much more comfortable. “Siri, switch off the kid’s
        bedroom light and read out my kid’s favorite bedtime story.” - don’t get
        lazy and impersonal though. Pay attention to what makes us human.
        “Google, recommend a nice bedtime story I can read to my kid?” - better.
        “Alexa, order a hardcover of Grimm's Fairy Tales” - your kid loves you
        even more.

      <b>SEO for voice searches</b>
      <p>
        You want to run marketing and Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
        strategies that make sure you catch the attention of the ‘hands-free’
        spectators. If you own an ecommerce website, you want to get the ‘voice
        first’ customers. However, competition is fierce
      </p>
      <p>
        Mobile voice searches, as opposed to conventional type searches, show
        less regard for those results that lag behind. The user only obtains one
        result - the result is named position zero or featured snippet and will
        be the single one to stand out to the user. The winner takes it all.
        This is why you want to be at the very top of Google’s or other Search
        Engine’s Results Pages (SERP).
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        The field of SEO is super dynamic, it evolves with technological and
        consumer-behavioural changes that are reflected in ever adapting
        algorithms proposed by search engines. We have talked about SEO
        strategies in a previous post

        In the next step, I want to present to you five simple SEO measures that

        1) Go mobile friendly and take advantage of Google’s AMP technologys
      </b>
      <p>
        Most voice searches happen through mobile devices still. A mobile
        friendly site is not only a site that optimally adapts to the size of
        your screen. It is one that provides you with the best user experience
        possible, including fast loading times and a seamless navigation. If
        possible, go light-weight with Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) featured
        by Google. It is an easy-to-integrate technology supported by many
        Content Management Systems (CMS), where AMP versions of each of your
        sites will be listed in Google’s result pages. Chances are Google will
        rank you better if your website is AMP ready.
      </p>
      <b>2) Embed structured data to deliver on rich snippets</b>
      <p>
        You can integrate structured data markup to your HTML code, that will
        show in additional, ideally relevant information displayed below the URL
        in the SERPs as a so-called rich snippet. Rich snippet results will most
        likely make you experience increased Click-Through-Rates and reduced
        bounce rates as users have more clarity on what they can expect from
        visiting your website. A rich snippet increases the likelihood that a
        voice assistant extracts the one response a user was looking for with
        their search query, so to match content to a user’s intention.
      </p>
      <p>

        softsourced has years of experience in the usage of JSON-LD (JavaScript
        Object Notation for Linked Data), microdata und RDFa (HTML5-Extension),
        the most popular syntaxes used for the implementation of structured
        data.
      </b>
      <br></br>
      <b>3) Long tail searches hold great value</b>
      <p>
        People treat their voice assistant like a real human, with a natural
        flow to their language. It is almost as though a user imagines an
        interaction with a person (“Hey Siri, what is the best Italian
        restaurant in Munich?”).
      </p>
      <p>
        On top of that, speaking is much faster than typing (100 vs 35 words per
        minute). As a consequence, voice search is associated with more refined
        searches.
      </p>
      <p>
        Long tail searches account for the majority of queries online. It might
        be worthwhile shifting the focus away from short keyword sequences (less
        than 3-4 words) to searches with a high level of granularity - check out
        the graphic below. There is less competition in the race for the top
        spot. Also, if you are into paid advertising, long tail can be a bargain
        since there is often less demand. Give it a thought!

      <b>4) Keywords and Google MyBusiness for local referencings</b>
      <p>
        Sie betreiben eine hybride Geschäftspräsenz, d.h. Sie bieten sowohl Offl
        ine- als auch Online-Shops an?
      </p>
      <p>
        You run a hybrid commerce, meaning you offer both, offline and online
        store? A majority of users apply voice search to find local businesses
        when they are away from home, e.g. "What is the tennis store closest
        by?".
      </p>
      <p>
        As a tennis store owner, you want your targeted keywords to contain the
        place of your business on several scales (city, department, etc.), e.g.
        “tennis store in South Kensington, London, UK”. This logic obviously
        goes for any hybrid business.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, set up a Google+ MyBusiness page and keep it up to date. It will
        give your commerce additional exposure.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <b>5) Address frequently asked questions (FAQ)</b>
      <p>
        People are inquisitive. They simply want to know. They also want to know
        about questions related to your website or ecommerce (e.g. “Do you ship
        internationally?). Listening to people’s needs and questions can be
        quite difficult in the beginning. Yet most of the questions are
        recurring. Note down the most relevant, frequently asked questions,
        answer them to the satisfaction of all your customers and display them
        on your website in a dedicated FAQ section. The voice assistance can
        read out loud the answers.
