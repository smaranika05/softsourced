<li><b>What is landing page software? </b></li>
   
<p>Online-conversions through online-measures such as websites or e-commerce are an important pillar to a successful sales process. In this very vast and dense market though, it is hard to find an easy way to an optimized website. An everchanging algorithm from search engines such as Google and Bing, complicate further the structure of a successful online construct. </p>
<p>Over time, marketers have found that a lot of beautiful imagery, a story and supporting information in order to sell your product are indicators of success. </p>
<p>However, if you are running performance marketing campaigns (Social Media or Google Ads), you will need a simpler page with less elements – a landing page. It has one goal and one goal only, to present the answer to the prospects that they were looking for. In an ideal world prospects land, read, engage, and get in touch with your offering.</p>
<p>In order to create a landing page, there is of course the traditional way of going through your IT-department or outsourcing the landing page to an agency. If you are one of the lucky ones to have an internal department helping you out – great. If you are one of the less luckier ones, that have to take care of the implementation as well, you’ll have to find a nice and easily replicable way to push content onto your landing pages. </p>
<p>Ideally, it’s just a simple copy+paste or drag+drop – offering the possibility to move things around easily, which allows marketers to create a tailor-made experience that catches the visitor’s attention and converts them into leads. </p>
<p>There is plenty of different landing page software out there – reaching from simple Wordpress structures to full landing page tools that let you choose from a vast variety of templates to customize your landing page content.</p>




<li><b>Who should use landing page software?</b></li>
<p>Landing page software is not for everyone, especially not when you are not a well-funded start-up or department that can spend as it pleases.However, there a plenty of use cases where such a tool makes sense:</p>

<ul style={{listStyleType: `square`}}>
<li>Entrepreneurs and performance marketers</li>
<p>Nowadays landing page builder appear to be the only way of giving you the opportunity to track your google ads and social media campaigns. It allows you to quickly conduct experiments and reduce your CAC (cost of acquisition).</p>
<li>Entrepreneurs selling expensive products</li>
<p>Expensive products generally need solid proof, e.g. testimonials, social proof, certificates. It’s better to portray this through a separate landing page that is optimized for keywords and give the reader exactly what he/she was looking for. You can of course implement this on your website, but things will probably start to look messy and confusing. Plus, it’ll allow you to maximize performance with the help of A/B-testing.</p>
<li>Marketers and entrepreneurs who really want to A/B test</li>
<p>Generally, A/B testing tools can be very cost-intensive. If you want to test CTAs (calls to action), offering in terms of value proposition or simply an additional feature, landing page software appears to be the simplest and most cost-effective way to do it.</p>
</ul>
<li><b>What’s Landing page’s impact on SEO?</b></li>
<p>Landing pages can affect your SEO (Search Engine Optimization) positively. However, it’s important to note that many landing pages are not structured appropriately for SEO. The Google algorithm is smart, and will skim badly executed Landing Pages, as they don’t show enough content or as components are not allocated correctly.</p>
<p>All the following tools are considered drag+drop solutions, that are easy to use, and can create quick results. Landing Page Builders are the perfect tool for marketers and entrepreneurs, as they can avoid code and with that save heaps of money. </p>

<li> <b>Conclusion</b></li></ul>
<p>As you can see, all landing page builders represent a different set of Pros and Cons. In the end I believe that it really depends on the type of person you are. Some need to have a completely intuitive software solution, as their expert-background is less technology focused. Others have tight budget constraints and are willing to put up with a rather difficult tool. Few landing page builders, offer the all-in-one solution concerning your online marketing. Others focus primarily on landing pages only, but excel in that area. </p>
<p>If  you might be  having troubles with choosing the right landing page builder for your business, start by figuring out what you as a business really need. In a next step you should compare your needs with this list, and define which tool suits your needs best. It might make sense to do your own research in this regard as well, as there are plenty of solutions out there, and this list only represents the Top 5 for the average use-case. </p>
<p>If your focus lies within functionality and proper A/B testing, choosing one of the rather costly solutions would make sense. However, if everything you need is a couple of standard landing pages, save some money and take one of the cheaper tools – great conversions can be accomplished with a 25€ spending per month.</p>
<p>If you end up finding yourself in a situation where none of the tools seems to fit, you can always go ahead and build your own tool. Softsourced offers a great solution based on an open source headless CMS. Get in touch for more information. </p>
