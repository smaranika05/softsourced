        <b>1. What is landing page software? </b>
        <br></br>
        Online-conversions through online-measures such as websites or
        e-commerce are an important pillar for a successful sales process. In
        this vast and dense market though, it is hard to find an easy way to
        optimize website. An ever-changing algorithm from search engines such as
        Google and Bing, further complicate the structure of a successful online
        construct.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, marketing research has found that a lot of beautiful imagery,
        a story and supporting information in order to sell your product are
        indicators of success.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if you are running performance marketing campaigns (Social
        Media or Google Ads), you will need a simpler page with less elements –
        a landing page. It has one goal and one goal only, to present the answer
        to the prospects that they were looking for. In an ideal world,
        prospects would land, read, engage, and get in reach out to you in
        regards to what you offer.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to create a landing page, there is of course the traditional
        way, either going through your IT-department or outsourcing the landing
        page to an agency. If you are one of the lucky ones to have an internal
        department helping you out – great. If you are one of the less lucky
        ones, you will have to take care of the implementation as well. You will
        also have to find a nice and easily replicable way to push content onto
        your landing pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ideally, it’s just a simple copy-paste or drag & drop – offering the
        possibility to move things around easily, which allows marketing teams
        to create a tailor-made experience that catches the visitor’s attention
        and converts them into leads.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is plenty of different landing page software out there – starting
        from simple WordPress structures to full landing page tools that let you
        choose from a vast variety of templates to customize your landing page
        content.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        <b>2. Who should use landing page software?</b>
        <br></br>
        Landing page software is not for everyone, especially when you are not a
        well-funded start-up or department that can spend as it pleases.
        However, there a plenty of use cases where such a tool does make sense:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Entrepreneurs and performance marketing teams</b>
            <br></br>
            Nowadays a landing page builder appears to be the only way of giving
            you the opportunity to track your Google ads and social media
            campaigns. It allows you to quickly conduct experiments and reduce
            your CAC (cost of acquisition).
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          {" "}
          <p>
            <b>Entrepreneurs selling expensive products</b>
            <br></br>
            Expensive products generally need solid proof, e.g. testimonials,
            social proof, certificates. It’s better to portray this through a
            separate landing page that is optimized for keywords and give the
            reader exactly what he/she was looking for. You can of course
            implement this on your website, but things will probably start to
            look messy and confusing. Plus, it’ll allow you to maximize
            performance with the help of A/B-testing.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Marketing teams and entrepreneurs who really want to A/B test</b>
            <br></br>
            Generally, A/B testing tools can be very cost-intensive. If you want
            to test CTAs (calls to action), offering in terms of value
            proposition or simply an additional feature, landing page software
            appears to be the simplest and most cost-effective way to do it.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>3. What’s Landing page’s impact on SEO?</b>
        <br></br>
        Landing pages can affect your SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
        positively. However, it’s important to note that many landing pages are
        not structured appropriately for SEO. The Google algorithm is smart, and
        will skim badly executed Landing Pages, as they don’t show enough
        content or as components are not allocated correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the following tools are considered drag & drop solutions that are
        easy to use, and can create quick results. Landing Page Builders are the
        perfect tool for marketing teams and entrepreneurs, as they can avoid
        code and with that save heaps of money.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>4. What makes a good landing page software?</b>

        <br></br>
        Landingi can integrate with various marketing performance tools and
        further, offers its own lead information interface. It is nowhere near a
        CRM tool, but can be connected and therefore at least cover the first
        stage in the pipeline, if used properly. They also offer a built-in
        platform analytics, which of course, is not as extensive as Google
        Analytics but can give you a great idea of what is going on with your
        pages.

        It is simple to integrate your preferred analytics tool, set it up with
        the in-tool reporting and track your conversions on its dashboard. They
        can also set up their pages to pass information directly to other

        The featured editor module appears to be basic, however, it offers a
        vast variety of templates that in terms of design, stand out from the
        broad mass. The tool offers the opportunity to (1) either build landing
        pages based on the existing templates, (2) or go completely customized

        Besides creating complete landing pages from scratch, the editor
        features the possibility to tailor pop-ups, call-to-actions, and many
        more elements that drive conversion. A stand-alone feature is connected
        to the exit-intent pop-up: even though controversially discussed within
        the community, it allows you to set triggers for exit-pop-ups, giving
        you the opportunity to target a very focused group of website-visitors.

          <b>Conclusion</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As you can see, all landing page builders represent a different set of
        Pros and Cons. In the end I believe that it really depends on the type
        of person you are. Some need to have a completely intuitive software
        solution, as their expert-background is less technology focused. Others
        have tight budget constraints and are willing to put up with a rather
        difficult tool. Few landing page builders offer the all-in-one solution
        concerning your online marketing. Others focus primarily on landing
        pages only, but excel in that area.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you might be having troubles with choosing the right landing page
        builder for your business, start by figuring out what you as a business
        really need. In a next step you should compare your needs with this
        list, and define which tool suits your needs best. It might make sense
        to do your own research in this regard as well, as there are plenty of
        solutions out there, and this list only represents the Top 5 for the
        average use-case.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your focus lies within functionality and proper A/B testing, choosing
        one of the rather costly solutions would make sense. However, if
        everything you need is a couple of standard landing pages, save some
        money and take one of the cheaper tools – great conversions can be
        accomplished with a 25€ spending per month.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you end up finding yourself in a situation where none of the tools
        seems to fit, you can always go ahead and build your own tool.
        softsourced offers a great solution based on an open source headless
        CMS. Get in touch for more information.
